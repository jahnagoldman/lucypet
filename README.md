# LucyPet
### LucyPet - iOS Application - Swift 3
- This is an iOS App to keep track of your pets. I also made a Django web application for LucyPet, so this is the mobile iOS app version. You can track when your pet last ate, went to the bathroom, took their medications, went on a walk, and more. Plus, you can set alerts to remind you when to do something for your pet in the future - both in-app and out-of-app notifications will show up.
